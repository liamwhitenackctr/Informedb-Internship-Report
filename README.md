# Informedb-Internship-Report
**Problem** 

The issue I will be addressing will be the military’s request for organized and presented data on projects.  

 

**Scope** 

I will be addressing the issue by mining all the data available on Jira and GitHub for the Informedb Project on the company’s progress in finding issues, starting work on said issues, and resolving the issues. The project will require me to find eight different Software Quality Metrics: 

* Direct Trends

* Total Defects found in the last 4 weeks 

* MTTR – Mean time to repair 

* Direct Removal Efficiency 

* Number of failed fix attempts (external)  

* Number of failed fix attempts (internal) 

* Change failure rate within release cycle 

Automated Code Coverage (in percent) 

All the data will be mined from GitHub and Jira, stored in an Excel file, and analyzed using RStudio, which will save my findings on a Word Document. This word document will be used for the final presentation.
