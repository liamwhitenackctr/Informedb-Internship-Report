That feature got put on hold to decide when we had enough time remaining.

 * Separate the visualizer changes into a branch and release with the old code; deploy the new feature in the next version.
 * Re-add the ""download project file"" action to the visualizer

UI/UX Issue: 
1. When showing this functionality to CEC they were worried about the ""permanent"" change that would come from Uploading the Gard file from the Viz. One idea that they said would work would you change the order of the selections in the ""Save"" list on the visualizer. If we could put the ""Save"" at the top that would be great. Gold plated would be able to have a confirmation box when trying to Upload the Gard file through the viz.

Fixed the issue with uploading and deleting. It actually did upload/delete the file, it just also showed an error message. Only happened on non-filter storythreads.","16/Jan/19 4:45 PM;MasonVines;Investigated and reproduced.

The issue of font size only occurs when you have windows scaling set to 125% AND the advanced feature for Windows to ""help with blurry applications"" or something like that.

 

The solution is to right click on jp2launcher.exe in the java bin directory.

Select the 'Compatibility' tab

Click 'Change high DPI settings'

Check 'Override high DPI scaling behavior'

Select 'System' from the drop down.

 

No current way to fix programmatically.

For the other filters, when updating, the user is forced to enter new text and then the update filter button is enabled. With the multiple choice, the selection persist so if I just wanted to select the ""Is Not"" for the same selections I have to deselect and then reselect. 
5. If the user has entered data into the search for a multiple choice and the search yields no results, the dropdown list now covers the ""Add Filter"" or ""Update Button"" and the user cannot click it. 
6. When the user updates a filter, the selection defaults to ""Is"" even if it was saved as a different option. 
7. If a selection in the data options is too long for the dropdown width wise, it dropd to the next line and blends in with the selection below it.

2. When a filter is first created, the ""Add Filter"" button is enabled even if nothing is entered into the field. If the user clicks the button they will get an infinity loading spinner and a filter is created with a blank field. 
3. The numbers start getting weird after adding 16 characters. The tool does not allow a user to enter numbers with greater than 16 characters so we probably wont run into the issue. But after the user enters greater than 16 characters the numbers are zeroed out. (For example if I enter 111111111111111111 into the filter field, when I click add/update filter, the number is shown as 111111111111111100) 
","06/Nov/18 10:28 AM;JohnSieck;Testing in IE, here is are discrepancies found between the mockup and the implementation:

0) when first opening the criteria dialog, the ""Apply filter"" button ought to be disabled until user types value into text field.

1) There is no space between the first and second row of criteria (Equal, Not equal, etc.) in the Add filter dialog.  There ought to be 8px of space between the options.

2) The number text field ought to match the width of the Apply filter button. Sometimes it did?  I refreshed and it appears correct now but...???

3) padding around the edge of the dialog is 16px.  It ought to be 20px.

4) There ought to be 16px of space above and below the line separating the criteria (Equal, Not equal, etc.).

5) the line separating the AttributeCaption from the criteria is missing.

6) criterion button height ought to be 28px and there ought to be 8 pixels between the button text and the sides of the button (padding left and right)

7) ""Enter desired number"" prompt inside the text field ought to be #a6a6a6 (blank state)

8) Border color of text field in rest state ought to be #a6a6a6.  It appears to be getting at least partially overridden by something.

9) I know we are not including error text as part of the MVP (sadness) but can we make the border of the text field red when an invalid value is entered (i.e. a letter or punctuation)? Currently, it disables the Apply filter button.  That's good as we don't want them submitting bad data but some visual indication of an error state would be good.

 * Add a filter criteria on the memo field (either a match or not, does not matter)

- If you save it and reload it after changing to a table, you will correctly see the results.
- If you've saved it as a table, then you seem to always be able to get back to the table (e.g., come fresh into a saved table with dev schedules / milestones, remove schedules, switch to pie chart, add rule, change rule to schedules, switch back to table - table appears).

In the future, it would be useful to make the text that represents a node configurable - for instance, the combination of a ""first name"" and ""Last name"" attribute. Having a ""label"" or ""handle"" value on every object would do 2 things:
- Allay the immediate problem of not having the ""short name"" attribute available to display something useful in the filter story thread list of objects.

Do not show the Kendo component when there are no records displayed due to 1) no results or 2) a new story thread with no records.  Instead display a message according to each case. 

1) No results message is as follows: 

Your criteria did not produce any results. Try modifying the criteria on the left to change what is included in your story thread. 

Tips for Creating Story Threads
- Try selecting different criteria
- Try selecting fewer criteria
- If using Date Range criteria, try using a broader range
- If using Search Within, make sure words are spelled correctly or try entering different keywords

2) For a story thread where no criteria has yet been set because it is new or because the user has unchecked everything the message is as follows: 

To populate your story thread, choose the items you want included from the criteria on the left.

If the criteria selected results in no results returned, I suggest we display the actual criteria so the user can easily see what combination of criteria produced the blank results.

It occurs in a few of the rows of the schedule on the cost2 column.  There is a formula for that column that is sometimes returning a non-zero number with lots of decimal places.  On import, that number is being represented in scientific notation even though it is being displayed in Microsoft Project as $0.00.
(e.g. the cost2 column of task “Implement Phase 2” is coming in as “-7.275957614183426E-12” instead of “-0.000000000007275957614183426”)

As a fix, we can change the line in DataEditorApi.cs
from: row[att.Key] = Convert.ToDecimal(att.Value.valueAsString);
to:     row[att.Key] = Decimal.Parse(att.Value.valueAsString, System.Globalization.NumberStyles.Float);

As a workaround for our General Dynamics customer who cannot import their schedule now, I have suggested that they round their cost2 column (which is the one with the scientific notation) to two decimal places with using Round(TheirOldFormulaText, 2) which will allow them to import before our fix has been fielded

I’d like to task someone, I’m not sure who or when, but I think we need to know and track over time the amount of “data” we have in each project.  I’m not talking about the size of the DB (e.g. 734MB), or the number of records (400 objects), all of which are important... but the total number of attributes and the total number of links.  To me, this is really the meat of each project.  You can have a database with 1000 objects, but with only 3 attributes each... psst – who cares – easy peasy.  You can have a database with 1000 objects with some attachments and a few links... psst – who cares.  BUT processing 1000 objects with 100’s of attributes and 1000’s of links could crush processing power and give us leverage for future service costs and SW/HW upgrades we could get paid for.  IMHO, those are numbers we should track.  We can claim success in managing project ABC with some metric like this... see how it has grown over time... maybe monthly or yearly... and relate these metrics with issues also...  on and on... 

Is this something we can document by running a “simple” script on each project?

This includes producing error messages that are polite, precise and prescriptive (how to fix it).

According to the Nielsen Norman Group, help is one of the 10 usability heuristics. Help systems should have 3 essential qualities:
Available without interfering. Some type of help should be available in every application or website, but it should remain out of the way until users need it. And when they do, it should be easy to find.

Succinct yet descriptive, in plain language. Help messages should use only as many words as are necessary, in a language that is understandable by lay people. (It’s amazing how many unhelpful help systems simply regurgitate the system’s own language: “checking the foobar checkbox activates the foobar feature.”)

Unintrusive. It should be easy for users to return their attention to their original task after seeking help.

Progress indicators, be they linear or circular, let users know that the system is still working to respond to their actions. Such elements inform users of the current working state and make the process more tolerable to the user by reducing uncertainty. Users experience higher satisfaction with a site and are willing to wait longer when the site uses a dynamic progress indicator.

Progress indicators were often built into our plan for a feature but just as often ended up on the chopping block when push came to shove. One of those features which does not tell the user whether or not the site is responsive is when preparing a PowerPoint presentation for download. The user does not receive feedback after clicking the button to start the process. For large presentations with many slides it can seem to the user that the site is broken. This results in frustration and distrust of the system and makes SimVentions look bad.

 # Enable SQL logging in the DB
 # Use a “quiet” DB that no one else is using so you don’t get a bunch of junk.
 # Execute an action in Informedb that has been showing performance issues.
 # Disable SQL logging in the DB
 # Filter through the logged queries and find the ones related to change log (You may also find that the app is doing an inefficient query N times)
 # Execute an Explain Plan on the logged queries.  This will tell you how the DB engine will access the data.  If there aren’t any indexes, it will have to do a full table scan (bad for large tables!).
 # Based on the predicates of the logged queries, add some useful indexes.
 # Execute an Explain Plan on queries after adding indices and compare access methods with previous plan.  You may also need to tweak the indexes to get the best query plan.  Query tuning starts to become more of an art than a science once you dive in.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

# In ObjectTypes.tsx, replace the call to GetObjectTypeForStoryThreads() with the NodeType version.
#* update the callback to insert a call to `setRelevantNodeTypes()`; pass the Story Thread NodeType as the only relevant type.
# in generateActionMenu(), change the `index` parameter to be a bare NodeType[] instead of a destructured TypeContext.

 * At the moment, GetObjectTypesWithSubtypes (aka GetObjectTypes) is being called in three places in ObjectTypes.ts: line ~226, line ~1475, and line ~1930.
 ** The call on line ~1475 can be removed entirely, everything that function does is also done by checkboxFormatter which triggers on the same event.
 ** The two calls on lines ~226 and ~1930 can and probably should be combined into one function, there's no need to make that call twice that I can see.
 * After roughly implementing the above changes, the total time the remaining GetObjectTypesWithSubtypes spent waiting was still an order of magnitude larger on localhost than it was on staging. I'm uncertain if this was due to differences between debugging and server capacities though, I didn't check any neutral benchmarks.
 * GetThreads is also now being called when it wasn't before, though I think that this is necessary.

- Manage Visualizer Project Files","10/Feb/20 10:39 PM;MattChild;The ""Uncaught type error: [...]kendo[...]"" is happening to me all the time on VPN - I can't get the page to load. I can't think of a reason why VPN would cause this type of error other than it makes it a little slower to load than normal.

I looked at the DOM, and it looks like kendo/kendoReact is pretty far down the list. Will bumping it up make a difference? There are also a separate set of scripts that are loaded in HEAD, but I don't think slick grid should interfere.

From Feb 20 meeting, routes to investigate were determined:
- Matt & IT would investigate whitelisting the script in the firewall to confirm the potential root cause
- Peter would look at (jQuery) Kendo usages to determine difficulty of replacement w/ Kendo React or Fabric components
- if nothing else works, we can try replacing the bundled version with a direct <script> tag to see what happens, but it's unlikely to make a difference based on current understanding.","25/Feb/20 4:12 PM;PeterMorrissey;Areas to test:

 #  Export Change Log: Entire content area scrolls causing the directions to scroll away. This is not like this on staging  JP: concur [FIXED]
 # Export Change Log: No spacing between list boxes and buttons. This is not like this on staging  JP: concur [FIXED]
 # -Export Change Log: In Object Types in the Report list box, if two non-consecutive items are selected and re-order is clicked (either up or down), the-
 -arrow can be clicked until they items are next to each other. This is different than how it functioned previously. (See staging)-   JP: I like this new behavior.
 # Export Change Log: Step 2 - current date box is off center vertically(CSS)  JP: concur [FIXED]
 # Export Change Log: Step 2 - User can't manually type in a date, only select one. This is painful if the date is many months or possibly years earlier  JP: user should absolutely be able to type in a date OR pick from the date picker control. [FIXED]
 #  Export Change Log: Step 2 - Clicking back causes ""Loading Object Types"" infinite spinner if error happens with API call or site timed out
 # Manage Visualizer Project Files - Scrolling causes the header to scroll away [FIXED]
 # Manage Visualizer Project Files - Highlight color is same as button colors causing buttons to seemingly disappear [FIXED]
 # Object List Page: Object Subtypes filter - If the selected subtypes exceeds the combo, no easy way to see everything that is selected. Perhaps a tooltip? (pre-existing didn't show anything, so this is a nice to have if JP approves).  JP: I think we are stuck with this, but this behavior is why I recommended a multiselect component like we have on staging in the filter (Kendo has a React version). But it was already implemented and at our meeting yesterday we decided to go ahead with what we have.
 # Object List Page: Object Subtypes filter - On staging, when all were selected the button said ""Showing All"". Now, the dropdown just lists them with no indication it is all of them [FIXED]
 # Object List Page: Object Subtypes filter - On staging, when there are no subtypes the button said ""Showing All"". Now, the dropdown is just blank. [FIXED]  JP: Maybe instead of Clear and Select All, the Select All just changes to Deselect All when all are selected?
 # Object List Page: Object Subtypes filter - Clear all clears dropdown and what is selected, but doesn't change what is filtered. See staging for expected behavior  JP: could not replicate [FIXED]
 # -Object List Page: Text Field filter - user can select subtype but the filter doesn't work-
 # Object ListPage: Date filter - user can not type in a date only click on the calendar to choose a date. Previously, they could type a date in. JP: Concur. User needs to be able to type in a date or pick from date picker [Fabric does something weird here, you need to click twice to start typing. Per Matt, leaving as-is for now.]
 # Object List Page: Subtype and Text filters - display options in order selected, not the order in the dropdown JP: Concur [FIXED]","05/Mar/20 12:32 PM;JohnSieck;Object List page: Object subtypes filter - is the drawing of the edges of the dropdown weird? The top third of the dropdown looks fine - you can see the shadow. On the bottom third it looks like the shadow is not being drawn consistently around the dropdown. Almost like some background objects are in front of the shadow.

 # The up/down arrows for word export doesn't tell what they do on hover anymore. (Move up & Move Down) Same with the side to side arrows. No longer ""Transfer from"" etc.
 # The scroll box for ""Include in document"" has a lot of blank space at the bottom. About half.

 # Objects List page: Apply a date filter that results in 0 items, then try to create a Text Field Filter. This control ought to be disabled (and possibly object subtypes?) if there is nothing to filter on. Deselect All is also shown. Not sure why as it does not apply in this case.

 # Export Change Log to Excel: Type in _After_ date, then pick _Before_. Modal disappears.",05/Mar/20 7:35 PM;PeterMorrissey;Fixed all three,"06/Mar/20 8:48 AM;NancyKraus;Issues From Test:
 # Export Change Log: Step 2 - current date box is off center vertically(CSS)  (3rd time this has been reported as broken)
 ** JP: concur
 # Export Change Log: Step 2 does not remember selection if user goes back and then forward (maybe pre-existing)
 ** JP: preexisting
 # Manage Visualizer Project Files: Upload and Delete columns appear clickable
 ** JP: Concur. Cols 1 and 2 are sortable, but Cols with buttons ought not to be sortable (or appear to be sortable / clickable)
 # Export Change Log: Step 2 - when the user goes to type in a date, the placeholder text does not disappear
 ** JP: preexisting, but it would be really nice if placeholder text worked like other components. Note this calendar component does allow user to click and type, rather than the one on the Object list page where you have to click twice.
 # Object List Page: Subtype Filter - if there are no subtypes, the dropdown says ""Uncategorized"". Previously it said ""Showing All""
 ** Case 1 - Obj has subtypes and none are selected. Dropdown says ""Uncategorized.""
 ** Case 2 - Obj has no subtypes. Dropdown is disabled and says ""No Subtypes""
 ** Case 3 - Obj has subtypes and all are selected. Dropdown says ""Showing all""
 ** Case 4 - Obj has subtypes and 1 to 1-all are selected. Dropdown lists Subtype names...
 # Object List Page: Object text field filter - by removing the list of fields that were selected, the user can no longer see all the selected fields when the selected text fields exceed the dropdown
 ** JP: My bad. Please add *Filtering on:* [attribute name] back in underneath the Filter Criteria component
 ** JP: Please add tooltip for both Subtypes and Text Field Filter that list all selected items on hover (after 1.2 sec delay).
 # Object List Page: Date Filter - on staging, date pickers have placeholder text: ""Select Date""
 ** JP: Concur. Good catch.
 # Object List Page: If the date filter causes 0 items to be displayed, the text field filter and criteria disables but the subtypes is still selectable.  Not sure what should be enabled/disabled and when. Example, if text filter causes everything to go away, should date filter be disabled? This also happens if the object type selected has 0 items, the text field filter and criteria is disabled but nothing else. 
 ** JP: revert to everything is enabled even when no results are displayed.
 # Object List Page: Object Subtypes dropdown, Text Field Filter dropdown and all controls in Date Filter have a blue border after the selection is made and they retain focus. The Object type dropdown and filter criteria text box do not. This inconsistency hurts the eyes.
 ** Replace with Fabric dropdown if it can be done in 15 min or less
 # Advanced Filter: Date filter criteria - when the user goes to type in a date, the placeholder text (month/day/year) does not disappear
 ** See #4

 # The Object Type dropdown now lists options to the right of the dropdown, not below it
 ** JP: Fabric component controls this behavior. I don't like it as it doesn't show up where I (the user) expects it, but I think it is acceptable given that a) it solves the mouse/scroll jumping around problem in Chrome that MJ found) and b) we have a release to get out. RISK: could induce issues elsewhere on the site (i.e. see Link Checked Objects to Object modal).
 # Word Export: Scrolling either list causes the header to scroll away (Same for Change Log Export)

Proposed solution is to update the component to what appears to be a list of items. When an item is clicked it appears as a pill (aka tag) within a container and is removed from the original list. Clicking the X on a pill removes it from the container and puts it back in the list. Typing in the container acts as a type ahead, narrowing the list.

Notes:
- Users typically refer to this as ""A minus"" dates.

Examples:
- If I change the anchor date on a page (like the spreadsheet modal) the relative date changes as well (after update call?)

Rules:
- Relative dates in the visualizer cannot be updated
- You get an error during import of an excel file with relative date column (non-atomic)
- Relative dates are only configurable at the taxonomy level
- Anchor dates must be on the same object
- "" Computed date"" can only compute off a regular date attribute
- PtoP should ignore relative dates when importing, assuming taxonomies match. A warning should be written to the log.
- Can't make relative dates writable with RBAC.
- You can use project transfer to import a relative date FROM another project.
- You CANNOT use project transfer to import a date TO a relative date in your project.
- If you delete the ""anchor date"" attribute, any relative dates show up as blank (null).

 * Create the table in the database
 ** In the SQL Project, the table should have:
 *** A foreign key pointing to the computed date attribute. This should be unique, and the primary key
 *** A foreign key pointing to the anchor date. This should be nullable
 *** A column with the offset
 ** The table should be properly index, and should cascade deletes
 * Update BuildRoadmap.sql with the new table. You should be able to pretty much copy-paste what Visual Studio generates in the SQL Project.
 * Update the upgrade script with the same code.
 * Update the Entity Framework model
 ** Create DateFieldConfigurationEntity
 ** Update the navigation props on AttributeEntity
 ** Update DbExtensions buildFieldDefinition() to include DateConfig nav property
 * Update DataApiRepository
 ** Update toAttribute in TaxonomyModelFactory to include the field config in ListData

By this point, you should be able to get dates with their configuration
 * Create a FieldDefinitionController, -Business, -Service, and -Repo
 ** All of these should inherit from AbstractCRUD
 ** Service
 *** Check if attribute exists
 *** Check if anchor isn't (complete/computed?)
 ** Repo
 *** Contains SQL implementation
 *** Should delete the configuration for an empty anchor or offset
 *** Reference the ScenarioRepo, it deals with a child table via ScenarioFieldValueHelper
 * For all of this, you can reference NotificationController - it has a nice CRUD path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Idea - ""Sandbox"", saving 1 or more gard file options to a story thread, being able to load any of them, gard files contain your changes and play them over top of the data.

This is feature #34 in the TTA / SSDS requirement options list. It satisfies a statement in TTA Task 1 (Subtask ID 1, 2, 3).

During epic grooming, this was estimated between 1 - 2 Sprints, and a medium t-shirt size.
*Example Mapping Session: 9/30/2019*
_Observations:_
- Project level variants would confer numerous benefits (both for users and site architecture)
-- The same set of changes could be shown in different visualizations
-- It may let us chip away at the restriction that you can only view 1 project at a time (because of reliance on the ""current project"" in the database)
-- No new editing capabilities would have to exist in the site (less components to build / wire).


_Questions:_
- Project level variants
-- How are sandboxes shared between users?
-- How do you switch sandboxes quickly (or back to the original data)?
-- How can we visually distinguish the difference between ""live"" data and fictional ""what if"" scenario (i.e., color of page being different) so you don't accidentally make changes to a sandbox when you were trying to make changes to the ""real"" data (or vice versa)?
-- Who can make a sandbox?
- Story thread variants
-- Are variants duplicated when filter is ""saved as""?
-- Variants need their own details (who created it, how old it is, etc.)
-- Are the filter rules variant specific? (Probably yes, but needs thought)
-- Do we change the ""baseline"" to the published variant?
- Both approaches:
-- Can anyone make edits in their sandbox even if they didn't have permission to ""officially"" change it (for RBAC reasons, for example)
-- How do underlying changes to the data affect my variant?
-- Is publishing atomic?
-- Is there a limit to the number of variants? (Probably no, unless there is a compelling technical reason otherwise)
-- When you publish a variant, is it deleted? (Probably yes, JP's wording suggestion was ""Make this variant the baseline"")


_Rules:_
- Create, edit, and share change between each variant
- Story thread level variants:
-- Would include basic filter, but not manual story threads.
-- Export to word exports the selected variant
-- Variants are deleted with story threads
-- Visualizer data changes change associated variant
-- Each variant probably does not have a separate GARD file.
- Publishing a variant must include some kind of diff.

 - The visualizer does not allow users add or delete nodes; only update them, and create links.

Technical Details:
 * There is a place to store it in the database
 * there is a path controller through repository in the C# layer to save that data
 * this will update the save endpoint to take an optional scenario ID
 * update the visualizer to include that scenario ID 
* perform a save when a new scenario is created (*before* doing the refresh that comes with changing the scenario!)
* make sure that saving into a scenario does not call the endpoint to update the links

Those macros are a little dated. They were among the first things I did here as well, so the construction probably isn't perfect.

8-9 months ago we had a meeting where they discussed additional changes that they wanted. I think the format of the data may change, the mehods/phrasing of the macro, and something about highlighted text / differentials.

 

I've pushed the existing stuff to a branch ""INF-UNK_IBPEZ_Macros"". They were excited for it back then, but I haven't heard since. I believe a few people at SimVentions were also using it. It may be valuable to reconfirm desired behaviors.

 * Test that doing a pair modification resets the match for the corresponding steps but not for the other pairs.
 * Test that dragging a type to a empty match adds it

 * Test that dragging back into the appropriate column resets it.

 * Maintain visual context of table when transitioning from Objects page to Edit state.  If columns shift around a lot or drastically change size, if sorting changes, or other visual contexts are changed, the user will likely have a hard time transitioning. 
 * When modal opens, column sizes are automatically set depending on width of content and overall width of table, but they can be manually adjusted by user.
 * When modal opens, sort order of Objects page table is maintained.  User can choose to sort on any column and that sort should be maintained between the two tables as the user moves back and forth.
 * User can filter the contents of the table via a text search / filter.  This enables them to narrow down the number of rows to more easily find and edit data.
 * Since we are auto-saving on the fly, users would like the ability to undo an edit or sequences of edits (just like Excel).
 * When hovering over a cell that is editable, the cursor changes to the pipe-y icon (just like when editing content in an Excel cell or a Word document.
 * When editing a cell, upon losing focus, the cell's contents save and the Saved button changes to Saving... just like the Manage People page.
 * When a cell has focus but is not in edit mode, arrow keys navigate individual cells.
 * Tab moves to the next cell in the row (or if at the end of the row the first cell in the next row).
 * Enter moves to the first cell in the next row.
 * When a cell is in edit mode, clicking enter moves the focus to the next cell down in that column.  This, of course, causes the save to kick off for the previous cell.

As a data analyst, I want to be able to quickly edit the data in a tabular format so that I can make many updates very quickly.

Initial thought is inline-ish editing for all attribute types. Needs to be done on the new ""Objects"" page, but assumes that has already been completed.

This is feature #32 on the TTA / SSDS requirement options list. It satisfies a statement TTA Task 4 (partially completes Subtask ID 17).

- The table shows an initial list of results (50)
- The status header bar shows the total number of items in the list (regardless of the number of pages currently retrieved).
- The column header is locked in place (it does not scroll off when you scroll down)
- Users can change to other data pages, which updates the list of rows in the table.

*Infinite scrolling* is a technique that allowing users to scroll through a massive chunk of content with no finishing-line in sight. This technique simply keeps refreshing a page when you scroll down it. infinite scrolling offers an _efficient way to browse that ocean of information_, without having to wait for pages to preload.  Infinite scrolling is almost a must-have feature for _discovery interfaces_. When the user does not search for something specific so they need to see a large amount of items to find the one thing they like.

Pros:
 * offers an efficient way to browse an ocean of information
 * scrolling provides even better usability than slicing up the text to several separate screens or pages.

Cons:
 * page performance will increasingly slow down**
 * Item search and location - when users get to a certain point in the stream, they _can’t bookmark_ their location and come back to it later. And in some implementations clicking the back button doesn't return you to your previous place in the data
 * scroll bars don’t reflect the actual amount of data available.

*Pagination* is good when the user is _searching_ for something in particular within the list of results, not just scanning and _consuming_ the flow of information.  Pagination works by presenting a set number of rows in a view, with the ability to navigate to another set. This example provides the ability to [customize the row count per view|https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*yLNoP3bNRc37jHn28Mqucg.jpeg]. Infinite scroll often replaces this pattern. Infinite scroll progressively loads results as a user scrolls. Infinite scroll works well for discovery websites but is usually disastrous for prioritization apps.

Pros:
 * Good for searching withing results, not just consuming the flow
 * Sense of control - Infinite scrolling is like an endless game — no matter how far you scroll, you feel like you’ll never get to the end. 
 * Item location - Having a paginated interface lets the user keep a _mental location_ of the item. 

Cons:
 * Extra actions - To get to the next page in a pagination, the user has to find the link target (e.g. “Next”), hover the mouse over it, click it and wait for the new page to load.

 

*When To Use Infinite Scrolling/Pagination?*

It's best suited for sites and apps that are _streams of user-generated content_ (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram). Pagination, on the other hand, is well-suited for goal-oriented sites and apps. Which are we?

Google is a good illustration for this point. Google Images uses infinite scroll because users are able to scan and process images much more quickly than text. Google Search uses pagination.  Reading a search result takes much longer. This is the reason why their Google Search results still use the more traditional pagination technique.","04/Sep/19 9:10 AM;MattChild;Based on the description it seems like we are both user generated content and a goal oriented site. We are going to have a LOT of text and not a lot of images, which makes it seem like pagination will be better. Further pushing towards pagination, I am not sure how the text search would work if we used infinite scroll, and the performance of the client machine may also matter because they're showing a LOT of cells (which is also a problem on the current object's page)","21/Nov/19 1:44 PM;PeterMorrissey;POC: Scott

 # Fixed. They should match now. Additionally, the top bar becomes blank during load to match the bottom behavior.

Everything looks good, but we also need another example with a chart. I would use either a bar chart or pie chart because those are likely the first we will use. One big reason to show a bar chart or pie chart is to flesh out how configuration controls will look. I'll take a pie chart as an example.

In order to show a pie chart, you need to choose some attribute of the data to group on. For instance, let's say you had an attribute called ""warfare area"" that was land, air, or sea. You would need some control to say that the chart should use warfare area to ""bucket"" the objects for display in a chart.",05/Sep/19 9:41 AM;JohnSieck;Added pie chart visualizations per PO request.  See blank state and pie chart below.  Still working on chart config modal.,27/Sep/19 4:25 PM;JohnSieck;Dev Team provided feedback today.

Dev note: What projects a user has access to is stored in two places. When adding/removing a user from a project and when saving a user in EM, both those places are updated. When project management was implemented, a lot of error checking during add/remove was done (can't add a user who isn't in the enterprise, return an error if user is already in the project, etc). These seem to be causing user's to get into a state where what project they are in is updated in one place, but not the other and it causes any further changes from happening. In these instances, the only way to fix it so far has been to go into the database and remove users from _Users in a project and/or all the aspnet tables in the enterprise database.

Design initial approach to analyzing data quality,INF-3370,39282,,UI Design,Resolved,INF,Informedb,software,MattChild,,,2 - Minor,,JohnSieck,MattChild,MattChild,10/4/2019 15:07,1/14/2020 8:23,6/8/2021 9:27,,Future,,0,Ready,,,,"After initial discussion with Alison about potential approaches and how they meet the 'Data Quality' objective, it was decided that being able to group by dates in the pie chart was the best intersection of utility and cost.

After initial research and discussion with PST, this is a list of the types of dates that they usually track:
- Start and end dates
- Capability dates (projected)
- Awarded dates
- Ship avail dates
- SCD approval dates
- Last updated date
- Recent changes
- Last reviewed (for documents, Nate's group does this 3 times a year)
- Deploy dates

For data quality, this almost certainly revolves around dates in the past. However, from this list, it makes sense to also look at dates from the future. One suggestion which seemed sound was to take a look at some of the ways we group data already (for instance, in the visualizer) and use that as inspiration.

Some date groups that sounded be useful:
- 1 week/30 days/90/1 year/ more than 1 year (for how recently the data has been updated, and is critical for meeting 'data quality')
- Next 5 fiscal years (or previous)
- Next 4 fiscal quarters (or previous)
- Next 5 calendar years (or previous)

In how they would use a date grouping filter, there was some uncertainty. In brainstorming, Nate thought one use case would be to find things that are mandated to be viewed in a year to predict workload (as in, to make sure there is enough staff to execute the reviews).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,31/Oct/19 11:34 AM;JohnSieck;Story Thread page - group by.png;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/18266/Story+Thread+page+-+group+by.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"- A list of the initial grouping strategies for date attributes (see description)

- What's in the display tab?
- Having the parenthesis after the field label feels cluttered - if the parenthesis add clarity, why not label the field with them?
- Looking at the Measurement / Dimension words without the explanatory note, I'm not clear on the difference between what Measurement and Dimension are configuring. Your note provides a lot more clarity - Measurement is ""Attribute"" and ""Dimension"" is ""Binning method"".
- I think the auto bin needs more detail but we can do that as a part of story elaboration.
- I think the 30 days / 90 days group option needs more elaboration but that can also be done during story elaboration.
- In your note under pie settings, you should say ""use a date as a grouping"" rather than ""use a number as a grouping"".","29/Oct/19 12:28 PM;JohnSieck;In response to Matt's comments because I cannot seem to reply to a comment:

Display tab is where use can set options for labels, color, etc.

Parenthesis is explanatory because I am unsure about the labels.  What will make sense to the user when we are asking them to organize by two fields both of which provide a type of ""grouping"" in the users' mind?

Feel free to suggest alternative labels for Measurement, Dimension, Group by, Auto Bin, etc.  Ultimately, we will need to sit with users and see what makes sense to them.","29/Oct/19 5:03 PM;JohnSieck;If dates are important, why not use a Histogram? A Histogram visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval or certain time period. Each bar in a histogram represents the tabulated frequency at each interval/bin.  Histograms help give an estimate as to where values are concentrated, what the extremes are and whether there are any gaps or unusual values. They are also useful for giving a rough view of the probability distribution.

!https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/anatomy/histogram.png!

Pie charts are good for comparing a given category (one slice) within the total of a single Pie Chart, for giving the reader a quick idea of the proportional distribution of the data. They cannot show more then a few values, because as the number of values shown increases, the size of each segment/slice becomes smaller. This makes them unsuitable for large amounts of data.

Are we trying to fit a square peg in a round chart?","01/Nov/19 4:52 PM;MattChild;Based on our discussion, you can close this. I will add my suggestions for bins to the epic.

Then have the objects filter be in a slide-in panel with a shared alternating body, and have some toggle or something to swap filter states. That way they can at least flip between the filters and not lose state.

_There is a space between the number and percent sign for all Valid values in the legend. There is no space for the No Valid Data option. We need to decide which way to go and be consistent._ 
 * This needs JP - personally, I think the space looks weird as all can be, but what do I know?

_Do we want ""No Valid Data"" showing if that is at 0%? It may be unnecessary._
 * No, this is a bug.

_If all data for the single select is filtered out, nothing is rendered for the pie chart, and no valid data is still 0%. I would expect a full circle of 100% no valid data._
 * If there are zero objects being returned by the filter, there should be a placeholder rendered. If there isn't, that's a bug. 'No valid data' is for when there are objects, they just don't have a valid grouping.

_If you change to table view, apply a filter, and change back to pie view, it does not update the pie chart and the results are inaccurate_

This is the way Excel works, and it would make the spreadsheet behave in a manner consistent with their expectations. It also makes several options available to you with only using the keyboard:

Usability entails the features in the app are more complete (i.e. being able to CRUD story threads from the story thread page). The tech debt we incurred was doing the minimum to satisfy a contract item and then often never being able to return to complete a feature to make it truly helpful.  Perhaps we prioritize by what we think the customer will not pay for in the normal course of business.  Here's some UI areas we could address:
 * Login page (first impression)
 * Homepage (also first impression)
 * Filter feature (panel filter options like [Metabase .33|https://www.metabase.com/blog/0.33/index.html] save vertical space for tabular data)
 * Nav and Command bar
 ** rethink breadcrumbs as positioning of command bar actions is better suited on left
 * Support site / Help (it's 2020, it's time to upgrade from PDFs)
 * Notifications - necessary to set up for future success
 * Design page
 ** Working with a taxonomy should not be so hard or take so long
 ** Rethink and reorganize where things go
 * Object list page
 * Edit an object
 * Visualizations in website to tilt the balance towards web and away from GARD/Java

Scope: 0.5 sprint

Contract language:
====================================
This is feature #38 from the TTA / SSDS requirement options list. It satisfies a statement TTA Task 2 (Subtask ID 5).
- SimVentions will design and develop data quality algorithms based on field completeness and attribute values.  

Initial Design Approach Key Points:
====================================
Story thread ""Pie Chart"" Visualization Page
- You can select dates as the tallied attribute for the pie chart.
- When you select a date attribute, you have some options for selecting ways of grouping those dates together into bins.
- One of the bins is useful for categorizing the LastDateModified attribute.

Elaborated implementation ideas:
====================================
Initial suggestions for bins are below. Name of bin, followed by the grouping mechanism.
- Recent Past (91+ days ago, 61-90 days ago, 31-60 days ago, 0-30 days ago, future, no date)
-- This meets the ""data quality"" requirement when selecting last date modified (referenced above).
- Near Future (Past, 0-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 90+ days, no date)
- Past Years (more than 3 years ago, 2-3 years ago, 1-2 years ago, 0-1 year ago, future, no date)
- Future Years (past, 0-1 year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years, more than 3 years, no date).

Other possible suggestions and ideas:
- Future quarters (Before now, next 4 quarters including this one, after this year, no date)
- Past quarters (Before this year, previous 4 quarters including this one, after now, no date)
- Current year (Before this year, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
- Long term outlook (Before now, 1-5 years, 5-10 years, 11-15 years, 16-20 years, after 20 years, no date).

Years would be useful as either calendar or fiscal, but fiscal is the most important.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,06/Nov/19 11:43 AM;JohnSieck;Story Thread page - group by.png;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/18309/Story+Thread+page+-+group+by.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ghx-label-4,,Data Quality v1,To Do,,,,,,,,2|hzysiv:,9.22337E+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have since changed that approach, but I added it as a comment here for posterity:

During example mapping on 10/11/2019, we discovered these outcomes:

*Stories:*
- Preview: .pptx file downloaded with one object of the selected object type

*Rules:*
- Object types can be reordered
- New object types are added at the end (when, for example, a new object type is added to the filter)
- In the generated PowerPoint, all the objects of a single type will be listed together (e.g., all the objects in ""A"", then all the objects in ""B"", then all the objects in ""C"").
- PowerPoint report file output can contain data about more than 1 object type
- User can choose from an existing template for a given object type or upload their own template
- A template can only contain data from one object type
- Report types cannot be converted (i.e., PPT to Word, or Word to Excel, etc.)
- Object types that are selected in the filter appear in the list of object types for which you can pick templates
- Removing an object type from the filter removes the object type from the list of object types for which you can choose templates
- The ""Download template"" link gives you a dynamically generated .pptx file that would have all the attributes and related objects from a field of that type


*Pending Questions:*
- If user has not picked a template for an object type, what happens?
-- Don't include in output
-- Placeholder
-- Field level error
-- Warn, then ask, do you want to export anyway?
-- Use a default template if available
- If there are no templates, what does the dropdown selector show? (is it just an upload button, an empty combo, etc.)
- If all objects are filtered out of an object type, what is output in the generated file?
- If all objects are filtered out of an object type, is that object type shown in the list to select a template for?
-- Matt: After thinking, my instinct is yes. If you had a rule based on date, and changed the date value so that it returned 0 results, it would be really weird to have the template you've picked disappear.
- How big will the list get? How will it scroll?
- Can you see the filter results?
- If there is an error is it displayed on the page or in the console?
- What should ""Download template"" be called?
- Are the objects sorted? how?

Notes:
We should examine our approach to required fields before taking action on this. There are alternate ways of getting fields populated that do not honor the ""required field"" attribute (like project transfer or excel import). It is useful for those transfers to be quick and easy and not have a lot of steps to resolve.

Rodney called me last week and said all the work we did is gone and the view profile is gone when I launched the ST.  I just thought he had done something wrong but in fact the GARD file had been wiped.

Let me know any additional information I can provide.

===============
-	Is it currently working for you? It seems to work at the time it’s saved and then and say a day or two when the ST is launched is when I noticed its wiped
-	Have you noticed this happening all the time, some of the time, or rarely? Ive only noticed this within the past couple weeks and it seem to be happening on the newly/recently created STs
-	When was the first time this happened? This is the second time Ive notice this in the past 2/3 weeks, I dismissed the first time.
-	Do you know the exact date / time of a modification that caused the file to get wiped? The GARD file seems to be fine the whole time Im working on the ST, I work make changes in the DB and the View profile and constantly save the GARD file back.  So its there at the time Im working on it, it seems as if its wiped between the last save and the next time the ST is launched.
-	Have you noticed this happening on any other projects, or only CEC? I don’t have an answer for this, sorry. The two specific STs this has happened to me are the Filtered SW Version 11.14 Schedule and the Filtered AC2 Milestone Chart.

====================

You mentioned you saved the file locally sometimes. 
-	Does the file get saved correctly? Yes
-	Can you manually upload it and have it work? Yes
-	Do those 2 story threads always cause the file to get wiped, or do they work sometimes? Those are just the two Ive noticed it happened to, both newly generated STs. Both generated within the last 3 weeks.  To be specific the first time it was noticed was on October 18th.  Rodney and I had worked on the new AC2 Milestone schedule all day on the 17th, making multiple changes and saving the GARD file back frequently because I was doing a lot of grouping and I didn’t want to lose it.  That next morning Rodney was to present to Program Office and called me first thing stating all the work we had done was gone.  That’s when I noticed the GARD file was wiped.  I uploaded from the file I saved locally and it worked fine.

3. Updated IE only to run daily, and tagged it. If we do a parameterized setup later, this can stay separate as the daily and that can be the manual.

- I like the overall look with the new command bar. I agree I think it will be important to have a simple listing of the scenarios defined on the project since they could become large.
- I like having the scenarios quick to access. We will have to define some scheme to make sure they don't overflow the menu and turn it into the project picker on the profile page.
- The top bar feels like it is getting crowded. ""Reports"" is not listed in there, and it keeps growing. It feels like filters and scenarios are both supporting elements, rather than primary elements, and shouldn't be a top level nav choice.
- The scenarios feel like they are a different kind of thing than the other things in the nav bar. They have the potential to affect everything that it shares the menu section with (data, filters, visualize, etc.), which makes it feel like it's in the wrong place. It seems like they should be in closer proximity to the project. I added a paper sketch to illustrate the thought.


","01/Nov/19 4:37 PM;MattChild;Page 2:
- Should the project name be completely replaced by the scenario name? it seems like it would be easy to lose context / orientation. Seeing the scenario name definitely seems useful - maybe in parenthesis after the project name?
- Comparing to the original project will be really useful, but that feels like it should be more of a contextual action based on the description in the note (in the command bar of whatever view you're on) instead of a top level nav bar
- Publishing makes a lot of sense at the top level, since you're publishing the whole cenario.
- You might want to have a page that's a listing of the diffs of things that were changed in this project. This would be a natural place to do the publish from. Maybe that's the first page you see when you click the what if? We would also need that in the future if we were to archive what you changed for later review.
","01/Nov/19 4:42 PM;MattChild;Page 3:
- Are you sure we should publish here? It's unclear to me whether it would publish the whole what if scenario, or only the changes viewed in the visualizer (which may be a subset). This could get you into some weird states where you have half a ""what if"" published.
- A simple mock up would be helpful (even if it was just a color replacement and some bad looking text superimposed in the bar
- In how I was imagining it would work, the visualizer would be tied to the way it was launched - if it was launched from ""what if"" mode, it would publish back to the ""what if"", if it was launched from regular mode, it would publish back to regular mode. If you start crossing, it may get very complicated very quickly (from both an understandability and an implementation standpoint).","05/Nov/19 3:17 PM;MattChild;Draft 3.1 looks good to me, it is conceptualized enough to start conversations with users.

I realize that a progress bar is much more complicated than a spinner.  A spinner coupled with the word ""Uploading..."" is fine.  I was assuming we would not be able to implement any such progress indicators on this first pass.

2. Display save on edit a different way from the save in the page (for instance, in a top status bar a la Microsoft Word)

Alan had some good points about the way that the site behaves now generally and that most actions require an explicit save. One of the key elements that they felt made Microsoft Word work in an ""Always Save"" environment was being able to undo.

Background
Given that Bob the Project Owner is on the Manage Rules page

Scenario: Add a rule
When Bob adds a rule
And enters valid data
And saves the new rule
Then the rule is saved and appears on the page

--------

A rule may have one group. A Project Owner may add a new group from the Rules page if the group they need does not appear in the list.

A rule has a description.

A rule specifies access for a combination of one or more object types, one or more attributes and criteria (aka conditions).

For example, If the object type is ""Hardware"" and its attribute value ""Status"" is equal to ""Planning"" then deny access to everyone in the ""Managers"" group.

Or here is a multiple example: If the object type is ""Hardware"" or ""Software"" and its attribute value ""Maker"" or ""Company"" contains ""Microsoft"" then deny access to everyone in the ""Smart People"" group.

The type of access is may be set to one of the following:
- Deny
- View only
- Allow editing
- Full access",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03/Jun/19 1:00 PM;JohnSieck;Manage Data Access Rules - beta.pdf;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/17446/Manage+Data+Access+Rules+-+beta.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"- P.O accepts ""good enough"" for revision 1",,,,,,INF-2941,,,,,,,,,,2|hzzkof:,9.22337E+18,,,5/10 - 5/23,5/24 - 6/6,,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a good time to increase our reliance the ""label"" concept, so there is a static field we can depend on.

Drew thinks it would be simplest to start adding ""Label"" to the views we generate. Even though that data is already in the ""Nodes"" table, adding it to the views would mean there's no additional joins needed to the ""Nodes"" table, which he was concerned might slow down performance and view creation.

","27/Aug/19 9:25 AM;RyanScranton;1. I never counted the active/inactive status of a project as part of RBAC. However, this should be verified to see that it is handled correctly if a project is inactive. My opinion is that the project should not be listed if the project is inactive.
2. I believe in this case, however the tool handles that now should be ok. I believe the user gets an error whenever the page refreshes if ""This Project"" becomes inactive. Is there a page refresh anywhere within the project transfer that would throw this error? 
","03/Sep/19 11:47 AM;MichaelJones;2. If they have other projects assigned to them, they are routed to the project at the top of their list alphabetically/numerically.","04/Sep/19 8:19 AM;MichaelJones;* When a user only has access to 2 projects (current & source) and access to the source is removed after the user selects the source project but before they click next, when they click next, the ""loading"" indicator will just spin until the user clicks ""previous"" or another link, or until an undetermined amount of time until logout (I waited about 20 minutes or so and it was still spinning).
 * A user has proj admin access and begins the Project Transfer process. If their access to the current project is changed to ""member"" before they select ""next"", they are still allowed to continue onto step 2. This doesn't seem correct. If they lost their admin privileges, it should throw an error saying so.
 * If a user loses Design privileges during the Project Transfer process, they are still able to continue the transfer process even though they don't show ""Design"" anymore. (see attachments) 

 ","04/Sep/19 1:45 PM;RyanFord;Here is that error from the Console: ""Access is denied. Sorry, access to the project is required to transfer data between projects.

 * Placeholder is inconsistent in styling. It can either fill the box or shift to the side

 * Clicking on the columns displayed menu will show a scrollbar even if the menu can not scroll. (cannot find an example on staging, but it probably does the same)

 * Deselecting all columns does not return to the placeholder text.

 * If the lav table is too large, it will force the modal to scroll horizontally. This feels weird / couldn't occur before, but is a result of putting a dynamically sizing component into a modal that previously had none, so I'm not sure what the result of that should be.

 * Every time I open + close edit it sets the LAV tables back to loading, and pops them back in place, regardless of modification.

 * The cursor should probably revert to the disabled cursor when hovering over a table in non-edit mode. It turns into a hand / does the on hover table functionality which makes it feel like you can edit it. That would be terrible right?

This will be heavy on design / implementation.

When people make objects right now, they usually fill in the data and then think they're going to come back and make links later. It's too many steps to add links when they're making the new object in the edit mode and so people put it off until later. Frequently, later is never until someone goes in and cleans them up afterwards.

If there were an easy way to add related items from the object details page, it may encourage people to do it as they go.

The best approach seems to be a ""quick add"" like add related so they can add links quickly. Jacob presented a quick design sketch, which is attached.

While we are modifying this page, it may make sense to do a quick change to the layout to make it easier to understand (see INF-3158)

I don't think anyone gave it consideration during the original transfer, so my guess is that it works the same as Excel does now where it would clear the value. Ideally, I think they would be incompatible but we can explain the behavior if that's not feasible.
2. Alphabetical sort makes the most sense to me here. They frequently like attributes to be listed in the order they are for an object type, but I think that for the context that you're working here it's easier to find what you're looking for in a small drop down if you can quickly scan the list. Also, since we're showing a subset (only the compatible ones), the ""object details page"" ordering is less important.","14/Aug/19 2:53 PM;RyanScranton;I believe that we implemented it so that the definitions HAVE to match in order to be selected.

Refined Estimate: Medium

In the Add/Related page, when checking a check box for an object the user has to wait until the check mark loads before continuing to select more objects. You will get an error and kicked out if you click too quickly.

On NSERC, it is really easy and noticable to make a crash happen when you click multiple links in succession without waiting for the check to appear.

This is a very old page and fixing it may be more expensive than remaking it. We should do a brief survey of options before deciding on how to handle this problem.

After a quick fact finding session with PST, people use this page when:
- They are removing many links
- If you don't know your data that well (it helps to see a list of items to choose from)
- When you want to link to 10 out of 1000 items
- When you are adding a lot of links
- When you are adding links across multiple object types and doing bulk changes

Alan also mentioned:
- A ""Check all"" would be really useful here.
- The ""what the object is already related to"" sometimes takes up a big portion of the screen and makes it hard to use for its primary purpose. It would be useful to be able to hide that.
- Being able to sort or filter the list of related items would also be really useful.

After refining, the best approach seems to be fixing this page by:
- Disabling check boxes after you've checked it
- Queuing the calls (if needed)
- Putting the list of related links in a scroll pane.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INF-3081,,,,,,,,,,,,,06/Aug/19 5:18 PM;MattChild;Object Details page add links.jpg;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/17749/Object+Details+page+add+links.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2|hzzhv3:,9.22337E+18,,,,,,,,2000,,,"06/Aug/19 12:54 PM;ScottSummerford;The difficulty of this story depends on the implementation - 
 * As far as I can tell, there are no batch calls for adding or removing multiple related things at once. There are ""batch"" calls that take arrays but ultimately just iterate through a list of data to make a single call on each entry.
 * If we were to keep it as is, and add a button to the top that says ""Update Related"" and does that iteration through list + single call, I think it would be the easiest way to implement it.
 * Likewise I think having a button that sets the ""All related items"" table at the top to be invisible / visible would be very quick.
 * Sorting would be more difficult because the table isn't traditionally made like our typescript stuff. Depends on how we want it to be done. Looks like it's alphabetical?

 
 * If we wanted to make the ""batch"" calls actually be singular calls, and make the sorting actually look good (or just the page in general), I think it would be better to remake. Though if we do so, it'd probably end up being a large story",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When filtering data, it can sometimes be useful to look for values that are blank to tell when data is missing (to know what to update), or show only things that have data.

CEC Example: We were trying to filter out anything that doesn't have an ""Applicable product"". Show a schedule that only had things that were linked to an applicable product.

This will be heavy on design / test.

Currently, Christy manages a LOT of data for CEC by using EDX to do the import. She exports out a spreadsheet, sends it to her team, and then imports the data back in. When she imports it in, she is responsible for the changes so she has to review them and make sure that they are right.

To meet the need EDX is currently filling for her, she would need:
- A way to see the list of what has changed (and what hasn't)
- An option to accept or reject changes individually
- A way to ignore columns in the spreadsheet.

Current EDX screenshot is attached. A companion story handles the ""data export"" portion of EDX (see related issue).

Other notes from Project Transfer ROM meeting: 
- Inline editing might be really cool here - correct any errors you see!
- If we did a big list of the diffs, toggling on and off diffs would be really important.

During the second review when we scoped it to a next step in the excel import wizard, this seemed much more achievable. It was noted that ""deletion"" was a significant chunk of that, with the diff report being a medium and the deletion being a medium by itself. ""Deletion"" was carved off into the related INF-3154, since it was not a core feature of EDX.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,INF-3073,,,,,,,,,,,,24/Jul/19 12:23 PM;MattChild;EDX Compare Wizard.JPG;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/17656/EDX+Compare+Wizard.JPG,06/Aug/19 4:56 PM;MattChild;Excel Import Options.jpg;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/17748/Excel+Import+Options.jpg,06/Aug/19 4:56 PM;MattChild;JP Excel Import Table.jpg;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/17747/JP+Excel+Import+Table.jpg,09/Aug/19 5:28 PM;JohnSieck;data diff.png;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/17776/data+diff.png,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2|hzzhvj:,9.22337E+18,,,,,,,,2000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right now, when you copy an object, you have to copy all the links or none and you have to copy all the attributes. It would be useful to be able to selectively choose what attributes or links get copied over. This would save a lot of time because making links (especially) can take a lot of time.

Currently people go and copy all the links but then delete them individually, but this also takes a lot of time.

Potentially could use a part of the time to do a part of the usability study

 ","26/Jul/19 4:23 PM;MattChild;There are two primary objectives to get out of the usability study:
- Rate understandability in site terminology and symbology. For the high level system concepts (""Objects"", ""Reports"", ""Story Threads"", ""Project Administrator"", etc.) and iconography (icons for help, download, etc.), figure out which ones are the hardest to understand or remember.
- Determine what users spend most of their time doing and why. We can use this to determine where the biggest efficiency improvements can be made (time savings in user activity), or the most frustration can be eliminated.

The outcome of this story should be a plan for data collection for these 2 things.

Alison suggested a 2 tier approach might be useful; figure out general area (which page(s) on the site) first then do a finer analysis when we know more.

If a survey is involved, a broad selection of users may be helpful:
- Implementation team (PST)
- Other SimV users
- CEC Users
- IWS Staff (Alison has a list)","30/Jul/19 2:18 PM;JohnSieck;Proposed:

1) Implement a [SUPR-Q|https://simventionsinc622-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/johnsieck_simventions_com/Eao_ISfPXrhPnjxEkBM7z88BAJrVslvtgngSpiHQ_fMVyw?e=4cFQBh] survey on the Informedb website to establish a baseline and monitor website quality over time.

2) Use the log file to try to gather analytics such as which pages are most used. It would be better to employ a tool like Google analytics but that will take time.  This approach is labor intensive, not as detailed, but it is expedient.

Both approaches above are quantitative and do not address the desire to rate understandably in site terminology and symbology.  To address that it qualitative (observing users attempt tasks) research is recommended.  Some of this can be gleaned from observations our trainers have made.  Other observations can be made by setting up appointments with users, giving them actions to do and silently watching them work, noting where they have trouble or where they work around the website to accomplish the task.","31/Jul/19 4:03 PM;JohnSieck;Based on conversation with Ali and Mike J, sent out an example of a hybrid card sorting survey and a link to card sorting 101 article.  Could help answer the terminology question - how users perceive and organize the information in the site.","31/Jul/19 4:04 PM;JohnSieck;Three ways to collect data have been proposed.

 * Spam in log file that is unnecessary (some columns should be skipped during diff because they are not part of nodes or edges but used during the diff)
 * Configuration of Link Attribute not imported on existing project (works if import to blank project)
 * Spam in log file was trying to update value of Link Attribute (probably should be skipped since that is calculated automatically based on configuration, links and value of related nodes)
 * Attributes with empty list data are updated when they shouldn't be.  In database, value is [], in PtoP file, empty space.  This appears as a difference during comparison

After a discussion with the Product Owner and PST, we decided to resolve this issue by implementing INF-2484 - Allow users to include object ID when importing from Excel.

 

Expected Behavior:
 * You can now select 'ID' when choosing the attribute that uniquely defines each object.
 * The ID field is included in the generated Template

If ID is selected as the unique attribute:
 * If an object of that type with that ID exists, it is updated
 * If no object of that type exists, a new object is created
 * If the ID field is left empty, a new object is created
 * If the ID field is not empty and not formatted properly, an appropriate error is generated

If ID is not selected as the unique attribute:
 * If a column labeled 'ID' exists in the uploaded spreadsheet, an appropriate error is generated
 * If a column labeled 'ID' does not exist, the upload proceeds as normal","20/May/19 12:57 PM;PeterMorrissey;Testing notes:

 * Smoke-test PtoP","18/Jun/19 9:59 AM;RyanScranton;Issues: 
1. In Simple Project PtoP 1 downloading a template for Test Object Type 1 ot does not give them the ID column. Selecting this Object Type does not provide ID as a column for a key either. 

EDIT - 

We have found out the reason for these attributes not showing up are that they are hidden behind a group. For all object types that do not have any groups, there is an ""ungrouped"" group that just shows all attributes. In that instance the ID attribute is shown. However, for those Object Types that have groups, the attributes cannot be shown because the ""ungrouped"" group does not exist and cannot be placed in a group.

1.) I'm not clear where the issue stands in regards to this comment - is this current behavior, or was this changed and re-reviewed? I'm not clear on where to proceed, testing wise.

2.) Agree with your comment that it's unusual behavior. There is significant interest from the user community for a much more in depth import (where you can accept or reject individual changes). I think looking at the process more holistically will allow us to address this (and other issues). This current story is just a stopgap until we can do that.

3.) You can also export the ID via a report in the Reports tab. Their likely flow (if they are doing this a lot) would be to create a ""data update"" report that they download and send out to other people that don't have Informedb access - that way they don't have to futz around with the URL to find the IDs.",17/Jul/19 9:17 AM;ScottSummerford;Passes test,17/Jul/19 10:54 AM;MichaelJones;Passes test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigate discovered the new dropdown used does not handle the '/' character well. It requires it to be encoded. So, for that object, the HW Suite was set, just not displaying as selected because the control was expecting an encoded '/'.

Additionally, when the HW Suite is edited and a value selected from the dropdown, the encoded value is saved to the database (AN/USG-2). From a user perspective, it displayed correctly, but will cause the export to export an encoded value.

Side note, because of how multiselect values are stored, if a value is deleted from the taxonomy, objects are not updated to cleanse the value from their selections.

If the user does not pass the hard coded login step (e.g., they do not have an active directory account), they will also be shown a ""account has not been approved"" page.

It is possible that this issue may not have an impact on actual users if CAC users can't change their password. However, this is a code smell and is worth a second look at the overall process. Nancy's powerpoint (attached) diagrams the failure - ""Is username & password right"" -> no -> ""Show user inactive user view"". The decision point is not just checking to see if the username and password is right, it is also checking with the account is active or not.

 Implementation notes: Login page has several different code paths. When fixing the CAC path, be sure to look at (and/or consolidate) the login process for all paths.

 

Additional note: Also look into providing accurate feedback when a login fails when not using CAC authentication. When a username & password is entered, all errors that occur when logging in say it is due to bad username and password. This happens if the account is locked or not approved as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,22/Nov/17 2:39 PM;MattChild;CAC Login (002).pptx;https://jira.dev.simventions.com/secure/attachment/15568/CAC+Login+%28002%29.pptx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2|hzy2pr:,9.22337E+18,,,,,,,,,,,"05/Jul/19 4:06 PM;MattChild;This story may need to be split.

Usability inspection is a group of methods where experts inspect a user interface to discover usability problems, the severity of the usability problems, and the overall usability of an entire system.

Technology Transfer of Usability Inspection Methods (Jakob Nielsen)

Participants in a course on usability inspection methods were surveyed 7-8 months after the course. Factors which influenced adoption were cost, rated benefit of the method, relevance to current projects, and whether the methods had active evangelists.

Usability Problems Found by Heuristic Evaluation: (Jakob Nielsen)

Heuristic evaluation is a good method of identifying both major and minor problems with an interface, but the lists of usability problems found by heuristic evaluation will tend to be dominated by minor problems, which is one reason severity ratings form a useful supplement to the method.

Just a thought because it would make sharing of a project with others easier rather than having to go to your profile and pick something out of the list.

We need to do more research with additional users to gather more feedback to determine the next step. If we go with an approach different than project transfer (like flatfile) it has to be an order of magnitude better for user experience than what we have now. If we go with a new approach, we have to expect to change project transfers to feel similar to whatever new approach is.

Notes:

Change the font/label headers and if there are two columns of boxes make the top column text vertical.

 - Font saves with GARD project
 - If there are 2 tiers of options, top header text should be flipped 90 deg.

When logging out display a page specific to logging out,INF-1460,32529,,Improvement,Todo,INF,Informedb,software,MattChild,,,2 - Minor,,,JohnSieck,JohnSieck,11/3/2017 15:34,6/4/2019 10:37,6/8/2021 9:27,,,,0,Pending,,,,"When a user clicks logout, they are redirected to the DoD banner with the Login page in the background. While this is logical, it cause extra cognitive effort for the user, wondering if the logout was successful or not.  Instead, display a page that informs the user they have been successfully logged out of the system with a link to sign back in if they wish.

Here are some guidelines for logout pages:
|*VISITOR QUESTION*|*OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINE*|
|*Is this the right place?*|Maintain a consistent branding experience. The Logout Thank You page should look similar to the logged-in area’s design. This is also your last chance (for a while) to reinforce your company ethos and leave your customer feeling good about the interaction.|
|*Am I logged out?*|Provide a clear confirmation that the logout process is complete. For example, “You are now logged out”|
|*Are you grateful for my continued business?*|“Thank you” is such a simple, easy thing to say. “Have a nice day” might not fit your brand, but the sentiment is one that encourages engagement.|
|*Whoops! I forgot something. How do I log back in?*|This is a very common need for membership sites. In the page content area, provide a clear link to the site login, even if you already have a similar link in the global navigation or site header.|
|*Hmmm, is there anything else interesting here before I leave?*|[OPTIONAL] Offer 1 – 3 opportunities to engage further with your company. This could be a new product or service, an offer of your newsletter, or simply an invitation to contact you.|",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"TBD - a mockup first, then development of page",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2|hzy2sv:,9.22337E+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 * Include username in email somewhere.  On environments where multiple users have the same email address, there is no way for the recipient to know which exact account a warning is for.
 * Include the server URL in the email.  If using the email templates, add %SERVERURL% in the templates and update the template code to replace that token with a configured server URL in the Web.config.
 * Inactive number of days in delete email under ""Why was my account deleted?"" looks to be hardcoded to 45 when using the template.  This should come from the Web.config.","22/May/19 1:42 PM;NancyKraus;Issues during testing:

 * We will likely need the line chart for visualizations.
 * The Data Access Rules icon doesn't really jump out at me. Maybe a lock?
 * ""With so few items the parent nav items can be expanded by default"" - there are no parent nav items - delete this?

Page 4:
 * ""Project logo is not MVP"". Project logo is not shown on this page. I think we should include it here but make it severable, because it will add a lot of value to both the new nav bar and the projects list page.
 * Sidebar selection color differs from previous page. _JP: No it doesn't, previous page shows hover state, this page shows selected state._
 * 

Page 5:
 * Remove ""Note: I presume..."". We may keep the banner, just put it in a different place (not on everyone's home page).

Page 7:
 * Data access level implies a rigid hierarchy, which is not how groups are made or defined. ""Data access group"" seems clearer.
 * Remove ""To Do: Determine...."" unless this is still pending.

Page 9:
 * ""Users want to be able to select all records with 1 click"" - What? Why?  _JP: What if the owner wants to take an action on all the users, or all but one user?  It is easier for them to select all and perform this action._
 * Should the check marks be the same as the check marks in the objects page?  _JP: Noted on page that discussion should occur among devs to determine whether to use Kendo or Fabric components (decision will affect check marks)_

Page 12:
 * If there is a default group, we have to define a way to make a default group. Nothing needs to change on this mock up per se, but this needs to be followed up on the ""Groups"" mock up.
 * There is a mention of the ""+ Add a new group"" link - that is not shown in this mock up.

 * Since doing the sharing with ownership transfer in this style dialog, maybe we should do it here too?  _JP: discussed with PO.  As a result, added Project Owner option to the dropdown._

 * Their current level should probably be the default (or unselected if there are multiple conflicting entries)

Page 18:
 * Do you think blanking out the details if there are multiple people selected is better than just showing the first entry?  _JP: Yes.  Consistent with reports.  Doing it this way to avoid any confusion.  Blank state also acts as a notification to user that they have multiple items selected (in case they didn't realize and start to take an action)._

Page 20:
 * Delete note. This will just fall out of date with the first version of this slide (page 3?).

Page 21:
 * I think we will want 2 versions of this logo. One for the project list, and one for the top left corner of the website. Would you imagine them just selecting a big version and scaling it?  _JP: The way I envision it, the logo for the project list and the top left corner of the website will likely be the exact same size / dimensions.  Simple, consistent.

If you copy an object type to a different project, and then create objects with that type, and then attempt to generate ppt slides, you will get an empty powerpoint.

If you go back to the original project, and either use existing objects of that the copied type, or create new objects for that type, they generate successfully.

Also, attempting to generate an excel sheet or a word document from a copied object type will pull the data from the object successfully. Similarly, if you make a new object type, add new objects, and then generate slides, it generates properly.

 # When the user clicks on the copy icon to initiate the copy process, the first option in the ""Copy Object Type"" pop-up, ""Object Type To Copy"" defaults to either the very first OT listed on the Manage Object Types page or to the last OT you copied if you have already copied one or more. Shouldn't the field default to the OT you picked to copy? If not, why is there a copy OT button on each OT listed?
 # When the user selects the ""Copy"" button to begin copying, there isn't an indicator advising them that the copying is in process, ie a spinning wheel. This leads to the user selecting the ""Copy"" button multiple times, thinking they didn't successfully click it the first time which leads to multiple versions of the copied OT with titles like ""2715 Test, 2715 Test (2), 2715 Test (3),etc.",22/Apr/19 9:13 AM;MattChild;Confirmed on patch-latest that these are existing behaviors.

If true, this may be fixable by running a tool on NSERC to disable certain TLS settings, or it may require a code change to force java to use a certain set of TLS protocols via system properties. This will be tricky, because the properties might need to be set for the actual JNLP file.

The calculation issue occurs in the data table as well as the roll-up table.

  

Please see attached. For FY17 - If there is a delta of 0, then the total is

0 even though in this example the total is actually 41.5K. Likewise is FY18,

the total is actually 0. Request was 388K, recvd 0 = total of 0 not 388K.

I attempted to add a filter on a decimal field equal to 9.9 but no decimal point is allowed (can't type it in) even thought the object has value of 9.9 in that field. For your reference: 'SimV Zoo' project, 'Animal' OT, 'Likes' attribute.

 

Next, go to 'SimV Zoo' project and '_Adv Filter 2' story thread:
 * Expand 1 Rule
 * Pick Animals as your OT.
 * Select Zoo for your filter.
 * Choose 'Contains' and type in 'Zoo'.
 * click 'Add filter'
 * Now click the OT dropdown and uncheck Select All.

The filter prompt changes to ""Loading..."" (a little early for that since nothing is selected) and Zoo and Zoo Keeper are still listed as invalid types. I would think all types would be available now that I have changed my OT selection.
Now close the dropdown. ""Loading..."" still displays in filter criteria dropdown even though nothing is selected in OT dropdown.","17/Jan/19 3:56 PM;PeterMorrissey;Both issues should be fixed now, thanks for spotting them",17/Jan/19 4:54 PM;RyanScranton;Passed Test,18/Jan/19 7:59 AM;MichaelJones;Passed Test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a particular filter Alan is using on his IWS 10 planning project on roadmap.simventions.com that will not fully load. The page will load, and the data will return but if you expand the ""Rules"" drop down, the page errors and leaves you in a blank white screen. Alan narrowed it down to an issue with the ""Carrier Planning and Execution"" object type.

 

Checking the roadmap log, there are a few lines that may give a clue:

ERROR 2018-12-11 15:04:37,766 27344367ms DataAPIFiltering       allColumnsForNodeTypes           - A type collision occurred for attribute: 'Location'.  'Site Planning and Readiness' has 'Location' configured as a 'String', but 'Amphib Planning and Execution' has 'Location' configured as a 'LinkAttribute'.  Please change the attribute type or the caption of one of those attributes. 

Two object types were included with the a ""Location"" attribute  that should be compatible (one string, one LAV to that string).

**Object Type 1: Site Planning and Readiness

Attribute 1: Location as a String

Object Type 2: Carrier Planning and Execution

Attribute 2: Location as a LAV to Site Planning and Readiness

In some initial analysis, It appears the error is due to some code duplication in the code that checks whether attributes are compatible (the code exists in 2 places, and 1 is only called in this one place). This may not be the actual issue though since it just prints an error and moves on. Nancy may have more detail.

This may also be related:

Error messages should be:
 * *Visible*  and highly noticeable, both in terms of the message itself and how it indicates which dialogue element users must repair.Keep in mind users with disabilities and never use color (i.e. red) as the only encoding mechanism; always include redundant cues that color-blind users can see (i.e. an icon).
 * *Preserve*  as much as the user's work as possible. Let users correct errors by editing their original action instead of having to do everything over again. For example, in presenting [ search results|https://www.nngroup.com/articles/search-visible-and-simple/], show a search box with the user's original query terms to facilitate revisions. If no hits were found, let users search a wider scope with a single click.
 * *Reduce the work*  of correcting the error. If possible, guess the correct action and let users pick it from a small list of fixes. For example, instead of just saying  _""city and zip code don't match,""_  let users click on a button for the city that matches the zip code they entered.
 * *Hypertext*  links can be used to connect a concise error message to a page with additional background material or an explanation of the problem. (Don't overdo this, though.) See errors as an opportunity to educate users.

Exceprt from https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/","28/Nov/18 1:18 PM;JohnSieck;h3. Potential errors:

See [https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/components/messagebar.|https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/components/messagebar]

A MessageBar is an area at the top of a primary view that displays relevant status information. You can use a MessageBar to tell the user about a situation that does not require their immediate attention and therefore does not need to block other activities.

Rather than try to document every possible error (impossible), we chose to document the major error categories.  These include:
 * Data entry
 * Download
 * Loading page
 * Timeout
 * Access (permissions)

Specific error messages ought to be written when designing and implementing a given feature. ","06/Dec/18 3:04 PM;MattChild;MessageBar looks like a good approach. As discussed, what we do next:
 # The only issue we've completed that this affects is the ""Save and continue"". We will update the ""Save"" story to annotate the messages for that.
 # For uncompleted work, we will annotate expected error states as a part of the ""Design specifications"" story as a part of the development pipeline.

Breadcrumbs are almost always implemented the same way, with a horizontal line that
 * progresses from the highest level to the lowest, one step at a time;
 * starts with the homepage and ends with the current page;
 * has a simple text link for each level (except for the current page, because you should [never have a link that does nothing|http://www.nngroup.com/articles/most-violated-homepage-guidelines/]); and
 * has a simple, one-character separator between the levels (usually "">"").

The place we deviate is not having a line underneath our linked breadcrumbs. 

I am good with adding the line back in or creating a story to do so, and then talking about our process at retro.

It's not too bad. But in everywhere you see this call, you have to pass a test object. If you write a wrapper in an Element class:

static void setText(String path, String text) \{
  TestObject elementForPath = findTestObject(path)
  WebUI.setText(elementForPath, text)

Then the invocation becomes:

To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this
application or computer (machine.config) must have the
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.
The application must also be compiled with debugging
enabled.

For example:

<configuration>
    <system.windows.forms jitDebugging=""true"" />
</configuration>

When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer
rather than be handled by this dialog box.

If there is a Rule that denies a user access to a given object, a user may still attempt to create an object of that type.  They will not be able to create one, but the only notification a user gets is a spinning ""Saving..."" alert that will not ever go away....ever.  

Two possible solutions:
1) Remove the denied attribute value as an option from the editable form. User won't know what they don't know and therefore cannot create an error or warning state.
2) If the value must be shown, on Save attempt, show user an alert (toast) message that reads, ""Access Denied.  You do not have permission to set the [attribute name] attribute to [denied attribute value].  Please choose a different value.""

Of course option #2 language may vary depending on the attribute type.

Current proposed solution: Warn the user what's going to happen.

This feels pretty close, but in looking at it similar attributes feel out of place when they are named the same. For instance, if you have a single select fixed name ""Date"" that has values ""Yes"", ""No"", and ""Maybe"" and an actual Date called ""Date"" , those values will show up differently in the UI and they will be clearly differentiable. If the values are represented in the same way (like with single select, multi select, and tag), it's unclear which is which, and also feels like a meaningless separation.

If two object types have attributes that are stored different but feel or are selected in the same way, they should be combined. For instance:
 * ""Animals"" has a single select fixed of ""Type"" that has values ""Big"", ""Little"" and ""Small""
 * ""Buildings"" has a multi select fixed of ""Type"" that has values ""Big"", ""Giant"", ""Glass"", and ""Occupied""

In this case, there would be a single ""Type"" entry that has ""Big"", ""Little"", ""Small"", ""Giant"", ""Glass"", and ""Occupied"".

Here is what I know after about 45 minutes of independent testing. I caution you…I can absolutely repeat what you are about to read.

 

Hypothesis: a single database object cannot have more than 40 relationships if these relationships are a LAV.

 

Considering everything we talked about yesterday…an Object Type with multiple LAVs (synced turned on).

 
 * I started from your theory that the timeout is occurring due to some factor.
 * I performed testing to see if the number of links (i.e. relationships) from one object to another would slow the database as the number of relationships increased.
 * I used the “LCS 0003 SRA FY20 – Copy” object from the Avails OT I created yesterday and removed all the relationships from it to SCD objects. Remember, we could not modify or delete “as is”.
 * After doing this I was successfully able to change the name of the object. Name changed Magic Number X.
 * I then used Magic Number X in the Avails OT to relate objects from the SCD Info OT. in batches of 10 at first.
 * Each time I added the batches of 10 I change the name of my Avails object (Magic Number) to Magic Number 10, Magic Number 20, etc.
 * As the number of related objects increased it took more and more time to save the changed name of the object.
 * When I got to 50 related objects, I could no longer change the object name from Magic Number 40 to Magic Number 50.
 * I then began with 40 as my starting point and worked upwards in batches of 5.
 * I started with 45 and finally worked my way back down to 40 which I believe is the number of related objects allowed to modify an attribute before the error occurs.  ","17/Aug/18 1:11 PM;RyanScranton;Scenarios that were successful to pass issue: 

1. Was able to update/duplicate/delete and restore an object that had 2 LAV attributes that had 75 links each. This was in the LCS project and Object Type that the issue was reported, however not the same object. (This was sufficient for the LAV Attribute having a lot of values) 

2. Was able to update/duplicate/delete and restore and object that had 18 LAVs where 12 of them had 40+ values. Not necessarily that many links because some LAV attributes had the same Object Type. (This was sufficient for the Objects having alot of LAV attributes.)

Pete did an initial investigation into the issue, and found this was a very solvable problem because it involved the way we were retrieving information about links and permissions in a very inefficient way.

 

Developer Notes:

Most of the slowdown was in the repeated calls to the database to check to see if the related items' and their object types were viewable.  Two problems here.  One is that we are iterating in the middle layer and calling into the database layer (horrible for performance).  Second, we should not be pulling data from the database layer into the middle layer if the user is not allowed to view that data.  Most of the time is taken in lines 167 and 168.  I (temporarily) commented them out so that I could generate slides while working an enhancement story without it taking forever to generate just the one test slide at a time.

Start here when looking at areas for performance improvement.

As a few examples: 60 days after project start, you have a preliminary design review. 120 after you have a critical design review. When this kind of data is represented in informedb as objects, each of these dates needs to be updated by hand. Most of the time, these dates will shirt in accordance with some sort of anchor date.

This is especially true with dates that are long term. For something 2 years in the future, the date represents a notional plan rather than a firm deadline. However, as dates become closer and collide with reality, two important considerations need to be handled:
 - Dates that are defined exclusively relative may fall on non-working days. If the date is X + 30, that will sometimes fall on a Sunday and not accurately reflect the actual date.
 - Plans are always subservient to critical business needs. It may be a best practice to have 30 days to verify and accredit a new system, but if that system is going out on a ship to deploy for 6 months then high-ranking officials may push to find a way for it to happen in 25 days.

Christy was going to discuss this more with Rodney to feel out (from a business process perspective) how they would handle those cases now.

There were a few discussions about implementation:
 - Defining a new attribute type at the taxonomy level, ""relative date"" and picking a basis field and offset.
 - Whenever you update a date in an object, give the option to update other dates.

Contract Requirement:
 The contractor shall implement a new attribute capability to calculate dates based on a related date

The taxonomy has baselines in it, and each baseline has related objects that contribute to the delivery of that baseline. The related objects are ""meaty""; there is a lot of information to them other than just the date - for instance, the Element Cert Event might have a location, commanding officer, etc. For the purposes of viewing the schedule for delivering the baseline, the only thing that's really relevant for the element cert event is the date, which is the ""Testing Certification Date"" to the baseline.

MC Notes: This requires a lot of thought on multiple fronts. One of the bedrock assumptions of Link Attributes was that they would only be displayed as text. While we could possibly parse those in the visualizer and isolate the change code there, doing so essentially commits us to propagating that functionality to the rest of the application. Another possible approach to solving the underlying issue is to have an ""aggregation"" capability in the visualizer's timeline; e.g., some rule  that would allow you to combine dates from various objects into a single ""line"". The concept would have to be explored more thoroughly though.

The data that is shown in these tables of related items appears to be unsorted. Since these slides go directly to the Captain for status reporting purposes, they need to be sorted and organized in a logical and consistent way (in the case, by sorting by fiscal year - which is displayed as a text string). To achieve the desired sorting, their process is currently to paste it into excel, sort it, and paste it back into power point. When doing this for nearly 50 slides weekly, this gets cumbersome.

Their team would like the ability to pick a column and sort how the related items fill out that column. The only required sort criteria are alphabetic (ignoring case) and ascending. In implementation, we should still expect to have a basic idea / understanding for how we might approach other sorts or changing ascending / descending in the future.

MattC,
I was able to reproduce this error on the CEC Copy project on Roadmap for the SW Baseline 2.1.10.10 story thread.  Attached is the GARD file.  I created a ‘test’ view profile and added a couple visibility rules similar to what Christy is using... and it blanks out the rule and actually excludes everything in this case.

Bad news: Test failed creating project named _Test_1506 ~!@#$^&()_+=-`[]_ on patch-latest with the ""Failed to connect to server"" message and any clicks after that give the user scary errors and crashes.  Subsequent test with _1506 Test 2 with ~ ! @ # $ ^ & ( ) _ + = - ` [ ]_ as the project name also received same message.

Filter page: Dates across types sometimes produce incorrect results,INF-1391,32352,,Bug,Resolved,INF,Informedb,software,MattChild,,,2 - Minor,,MatthewDavis,MattChild,MattChild,10/18/2017 15:15,2/6/2018 10:04,6/8/2021 9:27,,Future,,0,,,,,"When selecting multiple fields of dates in both the FROM and TO column, the way they are combined sometimes produce undesirable results.

+ Date A
+ Date B
Date C


TO: 12/31/2018

All objects from both ""Animals"" and ""Barrels"" will match.

Due to initial investigation of the SQL query, this is due to the way the query is realized:
( ( (Date A after 1/1/2016) or (Date A is marker date) OR
(Date B after 1/1/2016) or (Date B is marker date) )

When selecting multiple fields of dates in the FROM or TO column, the way they are combined sometimes produces undesirable results. Consider the following setup:

Object Type 'Animals' has Cheetah with Date of Birth as 11/1/2015
 Object Type 'Barrels' has Wood Wine Barrel with Manufactured Date of 1/2/2016
 Object Type ""Cars' has Mercedes Benz with Inspection Date of 11/15/2017

FROM:1/2/2016
 + Date of Birth
 + Inspection Date
 + Manufactured Date

All objects from ""Animals"", ""Barrels"" and Cards will match even though the Cheetah has a Date of Birth prior to the entered date of 1/2/2016. Now do the following:

FROM:1/2/2016
 + Date of Birth
    Inspection Date
    Manufactured Date

The Animals/Cheetah object no longer appears in the list. This is correct.

It seems that whenever more than one date attribute is selected all the objects appear even if the date entered should remove them from the story thread.  This holds true for both FROM or TO fields.

One possible implementation of this would be to define high level activities that the project does that new users would be looking for. For example, ""Fleet Support"" may be the name of the project, but the needs they serve might be:

Many customers clear out the label field of a node and instead use label annotations to display the ""real"" name of that node. As such, in the node tree or the ""Create Links"" dialog, it's difficult to identify which node is which because they are all ""Untiltled"".

MC Notes: If people are circumventing the use of labels, this indicates a problem in the way labels are being presented. Label annotations are meant to provide supporting information about the node itself, not being used as a primary mechanism for identifying a node. The system needs a ""label"" design construct to be able to concisely represent that node to a user. This likely means we need to look at how the various views are interpreting and using the label attribute, and provide more options for how it is presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2|hzy48n:,9.22337E+18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chirsty's proposal was to have the ""Always include new links"" check box go back and retroactively add all previously linked objects.  This may potentially lead to confusing situations if the user is allowed to edit the link attributes after this has been checked - so we may also need to disable editing if the check box is checked.

If she tries to filter on something for the Avail Name no items are filtered, however, when she filters on a different attribute and then tried to filter on Avail Name again, it works properly. 

Steps:

•	In CEC DB go to the Object List page for “Platform Avails” 
•	Filter on “Avail Name” attribute (You can filter on anything it won’t work) 
•	Filter on a different attribute in the column view (The filter will work for that attribute) 
•	Filter on “Avail Name” attribute (The filter will work now) 

We have had difficulty reproducing this. Dan has worked with Ryan in testing it. It may be related to a particular database.

2)	If the Original project has an XYZ String… and the Destination Project it was an XYZ Memo, the result after the merge will be two XYZ fields (one string and one memo).

So if you change the object type on the lav attribute  'Current Company', it will wipe out current company values in object details.

After Brittany found the issue with listData not saving, I found that the cause was commas existing in SubType properties. This was fixed on the upgrade script so that it does not happen again, and I subsequently went through all projects that also had that issue and fixed them manually. 

Next issue found was with '&' characters being encoded in the json string, but not accounting for that when using the name property to find the SubType Id. This was fixed, and I am looking for other possible characters that may cause issues similar.

In your LCS example, you have SCDs LAV’ing to AVAIL, and an AVAIL LAVing to SCDs… specifically, 16865 LAVs to LCS 0003 SRA(d) FY17-1… and you also LAV LCS 0003 SRA(d) FY17-1 to 16865 in another LAV attribute.  That’s a no-no right now.  

In LCS 0003 SRA(d) FY17-1 object, as soon as I unchecked the 16865 from that objects LAV, it worked on both sides.

This could be an easy usability idea (or not…)

As I’m trying to review and update data, I want to easily cycle through objects (on the editor page) without having to go back to the list and pick the next one in the list to work on.  

I don’t know if there is a way to implement a “next and previous XXX” button that makes sense but it might help with reducing the number of clicks to do something.

The important piece of this email is... MDA is requiring someone with a Security+ to manage the install.  Since Matt Davis is the only developer in IRT that has a Security+, he will be the responsible engineer.  I trust in MattD and our team to help as we complete this very important install for our BMD customer.  I’m sorry I don’t have more... but for now, this is just an FYI.  

MattD, please review the install instructions and become familiar with InformedB install process... leverage MattC, Pete, and Tram; they will support you through all of this.

               Column A: AAAObject1, AAAObject2, AAAObject3

Informedb must be able to link objects of the same ObjectType (AAA) and between different ObjectTypes (BBB): column D.  

Informedb must have a Wizard that allows the user to select which columns are the parent objects (Column A), which columns are the children objects (Column D)… and all other columns would be attributes of parent object(s) (Column (B & C).

Two examples are listed below. In each of these, it looks like data, RBAC rules or attributes not being in groups can prevent any attribute from showing up as a key. What should be displayed to the user?

**Staging: 

    'Animal Copy' -> 'ZZ_Ryan2_test'

        'All Attributes 2' -> '+*allREQ'*+

the allREQ object type has NULL 'choose attribute' options. Nothing appears underneath the 'Find' searchbar in the popup.

– This appears very similar to the state of a dropdown whose data has not loaded yet. Not sure if this is the cause or just similar

 

**Latest:

    'CEC02272018' -> 'Demo and Training'

        '+*Safety Events*+' -> 'User Interface'

               ***'*+*T&E Events*+' -> 'Test User'

The bolded object types have no selectable options in the dropdown. 'display title' and 'shortname' both exist but are grayed out and not selectable.
